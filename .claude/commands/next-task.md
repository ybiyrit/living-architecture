# Next Task

Find the next available task, considering parallel work streams.

## Workflow

1. Run `pnpm nx list-tasks dev-workflow` to get tasks from all active PRD milestones
2. Read active PRD(s) from `docs/project/PRD/active/`
3. Parse each PRD's Parallelization section to identify tracks (requires YAML track definitions)
4. Map tasks to tracks via deliverable refs in task body
5. Identify busy tracks (tasks with assignees)
6. Recommend task from idle track
7. Present recommendation with alternatives

## Track Mapping

Look for deliverable references in task body:

- `PRD Section: M2.3` or `Traceability: M2-D3` - Milestone and deliverable reference
- `Deliverable: D3.1` - Deliverable reference
- `Research-R1` or `PRD Section: Research-R1` - Research track
- Section numbers like `3.4`, `D2.5` - Match to PRD deliverable numbering

Match these to track definitions in the PRD Parallelization section. Tracks must be defined in YAML format:

```yaml
tracks:
  - id: A
    name: Extraction
    deliverables: [M1, M2, D3.3, M5]
  - id: B
    name: Conventions
    deliverables: [D3.1, D3.2, D4.1]
  - id: C
    name: Research
    deliverables: [R1]
```

See `docs/conventions/prd-track-format.md` for the full YAML schema.

## Output Format

Every item uses the same format - PRD tracks and non-milestone categories:

```text
Track: PRD12-A (Extraction)
Status: in progress
Issue: #165 (@NTCoding)
────────────────────────────────────────
Track: PRD12-B (Conventions)
Status: ready
Issue: #167
────────────────────────────────────────
Track: PRD12-C (Research)
Status: ready
Issue: #171
────────────────────────────────────────
Track: Tech Improvements
Status: 1 available
Issue: #174
────────────────────────────────────────
Track: Bugs
Status: none
Issue: —
────────────────────────────────────────
Track: Ideas
Status: none
Issue: —
────────────────────────────────────────

## Available tracks

- PRD12-B: #167 - Create conventions interfaces
- PRD12-C: #171 - Evaluate local LLM for metadata extraction
- Tech Improvements: #174 - Add RFC-008 to review checks

## Recommendation

PRD12-B: #167 - Create conventions interfaces (earliest PRD track)
```

**Status values:**
- **in progress** - Assigned task (show issue # and @assignee)
- **blocked by X** - Next task depends on another track
- **ready** - Unassigned tasks available
- **idle** - No open tasks for this track
- **X available** - For non-milestone categories
- **none** - No tasks in this category

## Edge Cases

- **PRD without YAML track definitions**: Error thrown - add YAML tracks to the PRD's Parallelization section
- **All tracks busy**: Recommend non-milestone task (bugs/tech/ideas) first
- **No tasks available**: Report "No unassigned tasks available"
- **Multiple active PRDs**: Analyze tracks across all PRDs, prefer earlier PRD
- **No active PRD directory**: If `pnpm nx list-tasks dev-workflow` returns an error, report "No active PRDs found" and fall back to non-milestone tasks only

## After Confirmation

Once user confirms a task:

1. Run `./scripts/start-task.sh <issue-number>` to set up the worktree and assign the issue
2. Output the following handoff message (fill in the placeholders from the start-task output and the selected task):

---

Task #<issue-number> is in progress. Switch to the worktree and start a new Claude Code session:

```bash
cd <worktree-path> && claude
```

Use this prompt to begin:

> Work on issue #<issue-number>. Follow `docs/workflow/task-workflow.md` from "Read Task References" onward. Read the issue body first (`gh issue view <issue-number>`), then read all referenced documents before creating a plan.
