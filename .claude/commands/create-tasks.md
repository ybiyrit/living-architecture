# Create Tasks

Generate well-formed tasks from PRD deliverables and add them to GitHub.

## Overview

This skill guides creating well-structured engineering tasks with sufficient context for independent implementation. The core principle: **slice work first, then document thoroughly with full architectural context**.

## Essential Requirements

Every task must include 10 sections:

1. **Deliverable** — User-visible outcome
2. **Context** — Business/architectural motivation with PRD file path
3. **Traceability** — Links to PRD sections, requirements, success criteria
4. **Acceptance Criteria** — Checkboxes for happy path + key validations
5. **Edge Case Scenarios** — Condition → expected behavior (separate from acceptance criteria)
6. **Implementation Guidelines** — Technical approach, architectural constraints, pattern references
7. **Embedded Reasoning** — Structured why/what/how
8. **Testing Strategy** — Categorized by test type (unit/integration/edge/performance)
9. **Dependencies** — Prerequisites that must exist first
10. **Verification** — Commands/tests proving completion

**Critical:** You MUST provide specific file paths for any referenced documents. The engineer must be able to implement without clarification.

## Pre-Task Validation: Example Mapping

Transform requirements into executable specifications using four card types:

**Story Card:** Single-sentence deliverable statement

**Rules Card:** 3-4 business constraints maximum per task

**Examples Card:** For each rule—happy path, edge cases, error scenarios in Given-When-Then format

**Questions Card:** Surface unknowns; resolve or spike before proceeding

### Edge Case Discovery Process

Before finalizing tasks, systematically identify edge case scenarios using the checklists in `docs/conventions/testing.md`.

**Apply Testing Heuristics:**

| Heuristic | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Count** | 0, 1, Many — empty collections, single item, multiple items |
| **Boundary** | Min/max values, just before/after limits, off-by-one |
| **Data Types** | null, undefined, empty string, whitespace, special chars, Unicode |
| **State** | Concurrent modifications, race conditions, sequence violations |

**Reference:** See `docs/conventions/testing.md` → "Edge Case Checklists" for comprehensive lists by data type (Numbers, Strings, Collections, Dates, Null/Undefined, Domain-Specific, Violated Domain Constraints).

**Output Format:** Edge Case Scenarios section using condition → expected behavior format.

---

## Task Size Guidelines

**Target size:** Up to one week of effort. Tasks can span multiple deliverables when logically related.

**Why larger tasks?** Claude Code works best with longer autonomous sessions. Larger tasks reduce:
- User interruptions for task transitions
- CodeRabbit review roundtrips (one PR per task vs many small PRs)
- Context switching overhead

**Split when:**
- Scope exceeds one week
- Unrelated concerns are bundled together
- Explicit blocking dependencies exist between parts
- Contains disparate acceptance criterion clusters with no logical connection
- Follows horizontal architecture layers instead of vertical flow

---

## SPIDR Splitting Framework

Apply when tasks are oversized:

| Category | Division Method | Sample Application |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Paths** | User journey branches | Different payment methods |
| **Interfaces** | Platform/UI variations | Web versus mobile implementations |
| **Data** | Content type differences | Image versus document handling |
| **Rules** | Business logic tiers | Basic versus advanced validation |
| **Spikes** | Research-first items | Investigation before development |

---

## Quality Naming Convention

Format: `[M<milestone>-D<deliverable>] [Verb] [Target] [Result/Constraint]`

**Acceptable examples:**
- `[M2-D2.1] Add date range filter to transaction search`
- `[M3-D3.2] Implement detection predicates for TypeScript extraction`
- `[M4-D4.1] Add riviere extract command to CLI`

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Vague phrases like "Build X system"
- Combined work: "X and Y"
- Passive language: "Setup" or "Implement" without specificity

---

## INVEST Evaluation Checklist

Confirm all criteria before task creation:

| Factor | Assessment | Failure Action |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Independence** | Delivers standalone value? | Restructure dependencies |
| **Negotiability** | Scope adjustable with stakeholders? | Define rigid boundaries |
| **Value** | User-facing or stakeholder benefit? | Reframe or spike separately |
| **Estimability** | Confident sizing possible? | Reduce scope |
| **Smallness** | Completable within one week? | Decompose further |
| **Testability** | Concrete acceptance criteria exist? | Write verification examples |

---

## Standard Task Document Format

```markdown
## Deliverable: [User-visible outcome]

### Context
**PRD:** `docs/project/PRD/active/[PRD-filename].md` — [Section reference, e.g., M2 D2.1]

[Business/architectural motivation - why this task matters]

### Traceability
- **PRD Section:** [e.g., M2-D2-2 "Create default extraction config"]
- **Functional Requirement:** [e.g., FR-003 "Support zero-config extraction"]
- **Success Criteria:** [e.g., SC-002 "Developer can extract without custom config"]

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✓ [Happy path requirement]
- ✓ [Key validation]
- ✓ [Essential behavior]
- ✓ A mergeable PR is ready for user review, created via /complete-task

### Edge Case Scenarios
- [Condition] → [Expected behavior]
- [Condition] → [Expected behavior]
- [Condition] → [Expected behavior]

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Architecture:** [Relevant decisions from PRD §9, citing subsection numbers]
- **Firm constraints:** [Decisions marked firm in §9 — must be followed exactly]
- **Flexible decisions:** [Decisions marked flexible in §9 — direction set, details can iterate]
- Use [existing pattern] from `path/to/file`
- Apply [design principle] from `docs/conventions/software-design.md`
- [Technical approach with rationale]

### Role Enforcement (for enforced packages only)

Include this section when the task involves code in enforced packages. Read `.riviere/role-enforcement.config.ts` for the list of enforced packages, allowed roles per location, and `.riviere/canonical-role-configurations.md` for standard patterns.

**Canonical configuration:** [Which pattern applies — e.g., "CLI Invoking Command Use Case"]

**Expected roles and locations:**
| Location | Roles | Files |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `src/features/{feature}/entrypoint/` | `cli-entrypoint` | [expected file] |
| `src/features/{feature}/commands/` | `command-use-case`, `command-use-case-input`, `command-use-case-result` | [expected files] |

**New roles needed:** [None / list any roles that don't exist yet — flag for user approval before implementation]

**Role questions:** [Any classification ambiguity to resolve before implementation]

### Embedded Reasoning
**Why:** [Business motivation]
**What:** [Technical solution description]
**How:** [Implementation approach]

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit:** [What to unit test]
- **Integration:** [What to integration test]
- **Edge Cases:** [Specific edge case tests from Edge Case Scenarios]
- **Performance:** [Performance benchmarks if applicable]

### Dependencies
Depends on #X #Y

### Verification
[Specific test commands or demonstration steps]
```

## Validation Gate: Push Back When Incomplete

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot complete ALL 10 sections with specific details, STOP.

Do NOT create the task. Instead, push back:

```text
Cannot create task '[task name]' - insufficient detail in PRD.

Missing information for:
- [Section name]: [Specific questions that need answers]

Please update PRD to clarify these points before task creation.
```

**This gate prevents:**
- Half-baked tasks
- Mid-implementation discovery
- Unclear requirements
- Missing edge cases

**Examples of insufficient detail:**
- PRD status is "Awaiting Architecture Review" → Architecture review must happen first (run `/arc-prd`)
- Deliverable has no `Architecture: see §9.X` reference → Architecture section incomplete for this deliverable
- Cannot fill Implementation Guidelines → Architecture decisions missing for this area
- Cannot fill Edge Case Scenarios → Requirements don't clarify behavior for boundary conditions
- Cannot fill Embedded Reasoning → "Why" is unclear
- Cannot fill Testing Strategy → Acceptance criteria too vague

**Action:** Update PRD, then retry task creation.

---

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Read context:** Active PRD from `docs/project/PRD/active/` + architecture docs referenced in PRD
2. **Read PRD Architecture section (§9):** This section contains structural decisions and domain model decisions made during architecture review. It is the primary source for Implementation Guidelines and Embedded Reasoning.
3. **Follow architecture references on deliverables:** Each deliverable has `Architecture: see §9.X` references. Read those specific subsections — they define the structural constraints for that deliverable's tasks.
4. **Apply Example Mapping:** Map requirements using Story/Rules/Examples/Questions framework
5. **Validate architecture:** Confirm PRD status is "Approved" (meaning architecture review is complete). If status is "Awaiting Architecture Review", STOP — architecture review must happen first.
6. **Discover edge cases:** Apply checklists from `docs/conventions/testing.md`
7. **Embed architectural context:** For each task, extract the relevant architecture decisions from §9 and inject them into:
   - **Implementation Guidelines** — package placement, layer assignments, dependency constraints, firm vs flexible markers
   - **Embedded Reasoning** — reference architecture rationale (why this structure, what skill principle drives it)
   - **Acceptance Criteria** — structural constraints that must hold (e.g., "no domain imports in entrypoint", "invariant X enforced by aggregate Y")
8. **Identify role enforcement requirements:** For tasks in enforced packages, read `.riviere/role-enforcement.config.ts` and `.riviere/canonical-role-configurations.md`. Identify which canonical configuration applies, which roles will be needed, and whether any new roles are required. Flag new roles for user approval. Complete the Role Enforcement section in the task.
9. **Structure acceptance criteria:** Happy path as checkboxes (separate from edge cases)
10. **Complete all sections:** Follow Standard Task Document Format
11. **Apply validation gate:** If ANY section incomplete → STOP and push back
12. **Validate against INVEST:** Confirm Independence, Negotiability, Value, Estimability, Smallness, Testability
13. **Create task:** Run `./scripts/create-task.sh` with completed content

## Documentation Task Detection

**When a task involves creating or modifying pages in `apps/docs/`**, apply these additional rules:

### Detection

A task is a documentation task if ANY of these apply:

- Deliverable mentions documentation, docs pages, or reference pages
- Implementation involves files in `apps/docs/`
- PRD deliverable references the docs site

### Additional Context to Embed

Read `apps/docs/CLAUDE.md` and include in the task:

1. **User Journey:** Which journey does this page serve? Quote the specific journey from CLAUDE.md's User Journeys table. If no journey fits, flag this — the page may not belong.
2. **Page Format:** Which page type is this? (reference, workflow step, overview). Reference the canonical example from CLAUDE.md.
3. **Cross-Linking Requirements:** What pages should link TO this page? What pages should this page link to?

### Documentation-Specific Acceptance Criteria

Add these to the task's Acceptance Criteria section:

- ✓ Page serves a specific user journey (state which one)
- ✓ Format matches canonical example for page type (reference → predicates.md, workflow → step-1-understand.md)
- ✓ All terms from `docs/architecture/domain-terminology/contextive/definitions.glossary.yml`
- ✓ See Also section with 3-5 cross-links using absolute paths
- ✓ No manually edited auto-generated files
- ✓ `/documentation-review` passes with no ❌ items

### Documentation-Specific Verification

Add to the task's Verification section:

```bash
pnpm nx build docs        # Pages render without errors
/documentation-review      # All three review dimensions pass
```

---

## Pre-Finalization Validation

Confirm before task completion:

- **Sizing:** One week maximum effort threshold
- **Naming:** `[M#-D#.#]` + specific verb + target + outcome
- **Architecture:** Vertical slice through all necessary layers
- **Standards:** Passes all six INVEST criteria
- **Documentation:** Engineer can implement without clarification
- **PRD Reference:** Explicit file path included in Context section
- **Edge Cases:** Comprehensive scenarios identified (not just happy path)
- **Traceability:** Clear links to PRD sections and requirements
- **Role Enforcement:** If task touches enforced packages, Role Enforcement section is complete with canonical config, expected roles/locations, and any new role proposals

---

## Creating Tasks

For each task, run:

```bash
./scripts/create-task.sh "<milestone>" "[M<milestone>-D<deliverable>] <title>" "<body>"
```

- **Milestone** = PRD filename without `PRD-` prefix and `.md` extension
- **Title format:** `[M<milestone>-D<deliverable>] <action-oriented title>`
- **Body:** Full task content following the Standard Task Document Format above

If a task depends on another, include `Depends on #X` in the Dependencies section.

---

**Note:** Tasks can include "full implementation" of a feature if it fits within a one-week scope. Decompose only when scope exceeds one week or contains unrelated concerns.
