# PRD: Phase 14 — Cross-Repo Linking

**Status:** Not Started

**Depends on:** Phase 13 (Extraction Workflows)

---

## 1. Problem

Real-world systems span multiple repositories. We need to:
- Merge graphs from multiple codebases into a unified view
- Resolve cross-repository references (e.g., event publisher in repo A → handler in repo B)
- Support polyglot systems (different repos, different languages)

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **External links first** — Mark cross-repo references during extraction, resolve during merge.
2. **Deterministic** — Same inputs always produce same merged graph.
3. **Conflict detection** — Surface merge conflicts clearly.

---

## 3. What We're Building

### Builder API Extension

```typescript
// During extraction, mark external references
builder.linkExternal({
  from: component,
  toExternal: {
    event: 'order-placed',  // Match criteria
    expectedDomain: 'shipping'
  },
  type: 'async'
});
```

### Merge Algorithm

```typescript
import { mergeGraphs } from '@living-architecture/riviere-builder';

const merged = mergeGraphs([
  ordersGraph,
  shippingGraph,
  inventoryGraph
], {
  resolveExternalLinks: true,
  conflictStrategy: 'fail' | 'warn' | 'override'
});
```

### CLI Extension

```bash
riviere merge graph1.json graph2.json --output merged.json
riviere merge ./graphs/*.json --output merged.json
```

---

## 4. What We're NOT Building

- Real-time sync between repos
- Automatic conflict resolution (user decides)

---

## 5. Success Criteria

- [ ] External links resolve correctly during merge
- [ ] Conflicts detected and reported
- [ ] CLI merge command works
- [ ] Can merge example multi-domain graphs
- [ ] Documentation covers multi-repo workflow

---

## 6. Reference

**Design Decisions:**
- `./docs/project/PRD/archived/PRD-phase-3-client-library.md` — Decision #3: Cross-Repository Edge Resolution

---

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Conflict resolution** — How to handle duplicate component IDs across repos?
2. **Partial merges** — Support merging subsets of graphs?
3. **Merge history** — Track which graphs contributed to merged result?

---

## 8. Milestones

TBD — To be defined during discovery.

---

## 9. Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Phase 12 (Connection Detection) — Single-graph connections needed first
- Phase 13 (Extraction Workflows) — Workflows enable coordinated multi-repo extraction

**Blocks:**
- Multi-repo visualization in Eclair
